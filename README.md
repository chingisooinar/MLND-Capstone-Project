# Capstone Project

# About

The Capstone is a two-staged project. The first is the proposal component, where you can receive valuable feedback about your project idea, design, and proposed solution. Currently, I am waiting for an approvement, hence this repository is going to be updated as soon as it gets approvement.

You can find the [capstone proposal rubric here,](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/410/view) and the [capstone project rubric here](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/108/view). Please ensure that you are following directions correctly when submitting these two stages which encapsulate your capstone.
